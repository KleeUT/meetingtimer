# Meeting Timer
Ever wonder how much your daily standup costs the company.  Or how much you spend in that weekly team meeting where everyone seems to be on their phones while a middle manager drones on, and on, and on? 

Well this is the tool for you.  

Put in the number of participants and how much they get paid, hit start and watch as the cost goes up. 

I've got it running at [https://mysweet-meeting-timer.herokuapp.com/](https://mysweet-meeting-timer.herokuapp.com/). Give it some time to start up it's running in a free Heroku instance.
